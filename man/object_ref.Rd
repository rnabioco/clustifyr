\title{Function to convert labelled object to avg expression matrix}
\usage{
object_ref(input, cluster_col = NULL, var_genes_only = FALSE,
  assay_name = NULL, method = "mean", lookuptable = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{object after tsne or umap projections and clustering}

\item{cluster_col}{column name where classified cluster names are stored in seurat meta data, cannot be "rn"}

\item{var_genes_only}{whether to keep only var.genes in the final matrix output, could also look up genes used for PCA}

\item{assay_name}{any additional assay data, such as ADT, to include. If more than 1, pass a vector of names}

\item{method}{whether to take mean (default) or median}

\item{lookuptable}{if not supplied, will look in built-in table for object parsing}
}
\value{
reference expression matrix, with genes as row names, and cell types as column names
}
